        <p>Python is a free, open-source programming language. Therefore, all you have to do is install Python once, and you can start working with it. Not to mention that you can contribute your own code to the community.<p>
<p>
Python is also a cross-platform compatible language. So, what does this mean? Well, you can install and run Python on several operating systems. Whether you have a Windows, Mac or Linux, you can rest assure that Python will work on all these operating systems.</p>
<p>Python is also a great visualization tool. It provides libraries such as Matplotlib, seaborn and bokeh to create stunning visualizations.</p>
<p>In addition, Python is the most popular language for machine learning and deep learning. As a matter of fact, today, all top organizations are investing in Python to implement machine learning in the back-end.</p>

<li>Simple and easy to learn:<li>
<p>Learning python programming language is fun. If you compare Python with any other language, for example, Java or C++, then you will find that its syntax is a way lot easier. You also don’t have to worry about the missing semicolons (;) in the end!</p>

<p>Suppose we want to print “Welcome to the world of programming” on our screen. Let’s compare the syntax for Python and Java:</p>

<p>Python Syntax:</p>

<code>print(“Welcome to the world of programming”)</code>

<p>Java Syntax:</p>

<code>class Simple{

public static void main(String args[]){
System.out.println("Welcome to the world of programming");
}
}
</code>
<p>
So here we see that Python code consists of only one line, but for Java, there are multiple lines of code just for printing a statement.</p>

<li>Career Opportunities:</li>

<p>Python has huge career opportunities in the IT industry. Almost every other IT company, be it a startup or a Multi-National Company uses python for varied applications. So, if you have good expertise in python, you will be in demand for a wide range of jobs in different domains such as machine learning, cloud infrastructure, web-site designing, testing and many more.</p>


<li>Large Open Source Community:</li>
<p>Let’s say you are working on a Python project and you get stuck somewhere, you don’t have to worry at all because Python has a huge community for help. So, if you have any queries, you can directly seek help from millions of Python community members.</p>

<p>Now, let's take look at the procedure to install Python.</p>

        <article>
        <p>If you are new to programming, then installing a programming language itself could be a herculean task.<p>
<ul>
  <li>Start off by going to this website -> <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></li>

    <li>Click on the downloads tab and choose the operating system and Python version. </li>
          </ul>

<p>Now that we have installed Python, let’s go ahead start off with programming.

        <header>Variables in Python</header>
        <article>
        <p>You can consider a variable to be a temporary storage space where you can keep changing values. For example, let's say we have a cart and initially we store an apple in it. After a while, we take out this apple and replace it with a banana. So, here this cart acts like a variable, where the values stored in it keep on changing.</p>
          
<p><strong>Assigning values to a variable:</strong></p>

          <p>To assign values to a variable in Python, we will use the assignment (=) operator. For example:</p>
<code>
a=10
a="sparta"
a=True
</code>

          <p>Here, initially, we have stored a numeric value -> <i>10</i> in the variable <q>a</q>.  After a while, we have stored a string value -> <q>sparta</q> in the same variable. And then, we have stored the logical value <i>True</i>.</p>

        <article>
        <p>Every variable is associated with a data type and these are the different types of   data types available in python:</p>

 <section class="main-section" id="Conditional_Statements">
        <header>Conditional Statements</header>
        <article>
<p>We use a conditional statement to run a single line of code or a set of codes if it satisfies certain conditions. If a condition is true, the code executes, otherwise, control passes to the next control statement.</p>
          <code>
            A=5
            B=10
            if A>B:
              print("Hello")
            elif B>A:
              print("Hello world")
            else:
              print("Hello programmers")
          </code>
          <p>There are three types of conditional statements as illustrated in the above example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>If statement</i>: Firstly, “if” condition is checked and if it is true the statements under “if” statements will be executed. If it is false, then the control will be passed on to the next conditional statements.</li>
    <li><i>Elif statement</i>: If the previous condition is false, either it could be “if” condition or “elif” after “if”, then the control is passed on to the “elif” statements. If it is true then the statements after the “elif” condition will execute. There can be more than one “elif” statement.</li>
      <li><i>Else statement</i>: When “if” and “elif” conditions are false, then the control is passed on to the “else” statement and it will execute.</li>
</ul>

        <header>Loops</header>
        <article>
<p>If we have a block of code then statements in it will be executed sequentially. But, when we want a statement or a set of statements to be executed multiple times then we use loops.</p>

<p>Types of loops:</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>While loop</i> We use this loop when we want a statement or a set of statement to execute as long as the Boolean condition associated with it satisfies.</li>
<p>In the while loop, the number of iterations depends on the condition which is applied to the while loop.</p>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gt2wPSB/while-loop.png" alt="while-loop" border="0"></a>


  <li><i>For loop</i>: Here, we know the number of iterations unlike while loop. This for loop is also used for iterations of statements or a set of statements multiple times.</li>
  
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/GWVW4d8/for-loop.png" alt="for-loop" border="0">
  
  <li><i>Nested loop</i>: This type of loop consists of a loop inside a loop. It can be for loop or can be a combination of for and while loop.</li>

  <p>Now, we will learn about user-defined functions.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="User-Defined_Functions">
        <header>User-Defined Functions</header>
        <article>
<p>In any programming language, functions are a better and systematic way of writing. Functions provide us the liberty to use the code inside it whenever it is needed just by calling the function by its name.</p>

<p>Syntax: <i>def function()</i></p>

      </section>
<section class="main-section" id="Exception_Handling">
        <header>Exception Handling</header>
        <article>
          <p>Basically, an <i>exception</i> is an abnormal condition or error that occurs during the execution of a program. Whenever an exception occurs in a program, the execution of the program halts and the further instruction of the programs are not executed.</p>

          <p>We need to handle these exceptions in order to ensure the normal execution of the program.</p>

<p>Some of the common exceptions that occur in Python programs while executing are:</p>
<ol>
    <li><i>NameError</i>: This error occurs when a name is not found.</li>
  <li><i>ZeroDivisionError</i>: When a number is divided by zero, <i>ZeroDivisionError</i> occurs.</li>
    <li><i>IndentationError</i>: This error occurs due to the wrong indentation.</li>
    <li><i>IOError</i>: When Input-Output operation fails, <i>IOError</i> occurs.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, in Python we use the try, catch, except and finally to handle the exceptions.</p>
          
          <strong><p>try-except block</p></strong>

<p>In the Python program, the line of code that may throw exceptions is placed in the <strong>try</strong> block</p>.

<p>The try block should have except block with it to handle the exception. As an illustration – If any exception occurs in try block then the statements in except block will be executed.</p>

          <p>Syntax:</p>
<code>
try:

     #line of code

except Exception:

    #line of code

#rest of the code
          </code>
          
<p><strong>“else” block</strong></p>

<p>In this case, the <strong>else</strong> block will be executed if no exception occurs.</p>

 <p>Syntax:</p>
<code>
try:

#line of code

except Exception:

#line of code

else:

#If there is no exception then this piece of code will be executed
          </code>

          <p><strong>“finally” block</strong></p>
<p>If we want a piece of executable code, which we cannot skip under any circumstances, then we need to put this code in the <strong>finally</strong> block.</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<code>
try:

#line of code

finally:

#This piece of code will definitely be executed.
          </code>
